The thesis consists of two main parts. The first part covers the mathematical modelling of Drinking Water Supply Systems with the aim of deriving a model which is suitable for plug-and-play commissionable model-based optimal control. The framework on which the modelling is based is motivated by \cite{oneinput_paper}, where the modelling of Water Supply Networks has been derived without Elevated Reservoirs. In the thesis, this existing model is extended by taking into account the dynamic effect of multiple storages in the network. For the identification of the graph-based extended model, a data-driven Neural Network(NN)-based approach is presented in order to accurately estimate the water level in the storage tanks and the pressure of the pumping stations. The method has been successfully tested on a real Water Supply Network located in Randers, Denmark.

The second part of the thesis covers the control design of the identified model. This work is about to be done during the $4^{th}$ semester.
