The thesis consists of two main parts. The first part covers the mathematical modelling of Drinking Water Supply Systems with the aim of deriving a model which is suitable for plug-and-play commissionable model-based optimal control. The framework on which the modelling is based is motivated by \cite{oneinput_paper}, where the modelling of Water Supply Networks without Elevated Reservoirs has been derived. In the thesis, this existing model is extended by taking into account the dynamic effect of multiple Elevated Reservoirs placed in the network. The graph-based extended model then attempted to be identified using Neural Network(NN)-based identification methods. The identification of the NN-based model has been successfully carried out on data from a real Water Supply Network located in Randers, Denmark.

The second part of the thesis covers the control design of the identified model. This work is about to be done during the $4^{th}$ semester.
