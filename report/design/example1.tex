\chapter{State of the art system identification analysis}
\label{identification_methods}

\emph{In this chapter, first an overview is given about the different methods for non-linear system identification. Secondly, the chosen method for identification is discussed in detail putting focus on the structure of the network.}

The data available in the simulation framework allows us to make a system model with the proposed control structure, however the complexity would be high. Try some black-box identification which can reproduce the same properties of the original simulation network but easier to handle in control.
