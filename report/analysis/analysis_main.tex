\chapter{Simulation framework in EPANET}
\label{simulation_framework_in_EPANET}

\emph{This chapter gives an insight into the simulation model of the Randers WSS in EPANET. In order to better understand how the simulation works, the modelling of the different pump stations, waterworks, and the demand patterns are explained in detail. In the end, an attempt is made to split the network into different subsystems and make necessary modifications such that data is easily extractable for system identification purposes.}

% \emph{This chapter gives a general introduction about the need for model simplification in WSSs. Different approaches and methods are discussed in a state of art manner, including the development and methodologies employed in this field. Lastly, an attempt is made to simplify the Randers WSS, using one of the techniques which are being introduced in this chapter. }

\section{Model and data structure}
\label{model_data_and_structure}

As it was explained in \chapref{description_of_water_supply_systems}, the typical components of WSSs are reservoirs, pipes, pumps and valves. Each of these interconnected elements are dependant on their neighbours, thus the behaviour of the entire WSS depends on each of its elements. For simulation purposes, it is required that the model of the real-life network consists of thousands of elements in order to accurately replicate hydraulic behaviour and the topographical layout of the system. Such models are appropriate for simulation purposes, however, online optimisation tasks are much more computationally demanding. Therefore the available data in the simulation framework has to be incorporated into a more compact model for control purposes. 

The use of Geographic Information Systems(GIS) in the water industry resulted in an increasing amount of information about actual network topology and service that can be utilized in a model \cite{johnson2016geographic}. As a consequence of this, normally the simulation model of WSSs include exactly the same amount of components as in real-life. 

The following data and model description is strongly based on the Randers WSS EPANET documentation (cite), provided by Verdo A/S, where the considerations about the modelling and the data processing from GIS are gathered. The model is mainly based on the data gathered in GIS, however considerations on case studies and experience have also been taken into account. 

Initially in the model, nodes were made among each different pipe elements, however this increased the calculation time significantly. Therefore the number of nodes in the network are reduced based on the fact that pipe sections with the same material and dimensions can be treated as one pipeline. The simulation model, including the VSV region consists of the following number of elements, as shown in \tabref{numberofelements_table}

\begin{center}
\label{numberofelements_table}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{3cm} | p{3cm} |}
    \hline
    \textbf{Element type} & \textbf{Number}  \\ 
    \hline
    Links & 4144  \\ 
    \hline
    Nodes & 4180  \\ 
    \hline
    Tanks & 6  \\ 
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \captionof{table}{asd}
\end{center}

It is important to note that the number of tanks in the model does not necessarily reflect the number of WTs in the real system. In certain parts of the system, the modelling reflects the real-world results, however the structure of certain pumping stations and waterworks are different. For the same reason, one pump in the model can replace more pumps in parallel in the real world. During the modelling,
