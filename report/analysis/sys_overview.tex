\emph{This chapter gives a general overview of hydraulic systems and an introduction to the WSS in Randers. The basic topology and structures of water supply networks are explained. Furthermore, the basic components of hydraulic systems are discussed and the unit called head, as an alternative measure of pressure, is introduced.}

\section{Hydraulic system overview}
\label{hydraulic_system_overview}

WSSs are designed to deliver water to consumers in terms of sufficient pressure and appropriate chemical composition. Distribution systems as such are typically transport water from one geographical place to another. In practice, there are different methods exist to achieve this water transport. One example is the use of natural advantages such as the water stored in mountains, and thereby use the potential energy of the water to provide pressure in the network. Examples for this are countries like Norway where the advantages of the landscape are being exploited \cite{norway_mountains}. However, in this project the source of the water is considered as groundwater, considering that in Denmark all reservoirs in the network are tapping water from the ground. It worth noting that the quality of groundwater in Denmark is sufficiently good to use it for drinking water supply purposes. After tapping the water, it goes through an aeration process at the waterworks and afterwards the pure water is pumped into the network \cite{prahata}. In WSSs, pumps and valves are the elements that enable the control and thereby the proper delivery of water to the consumers or to elevated reservoirs, storing water for later use. Such a network is illustrated in the figure below: 

%illustration of WSS
\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.63\textwidth]{report/pictures/WSS_illustration}
\caption{Illustration of a WSS \cite{kenneth_houe}.}
\label{fig:WSS_example}
\end{figure}

The delivered water needs to fulfil a certain pressure criteria in order to reach consumers at higher levels. For example, in some cases the pressure has to be high enough to make it to the fourth floor of a building and still provide appropriate pressure in the water taps. Generally, in such cases booster pumps are placed in the basement of buildings, helping to supply the pressure. Too large pressure values, however increase water losses due to pipe waste \cite{walski2003advanced}.

Another criteria is that the flow through particular pipes need to stay within acceptable limits. A low flow rate can lead to water quality problems due to the undesirable microorganisms in the water and due to the metal and salt accumulation on the wall of the pipes \cite{walski2003advanced}. 

As can be seen in \figref{fig:WSS_example}, typically WSSs consist of pipe, valve, reservoir, elevated reservoir(tank) and pump components. The common property of them is that they are all two-terminal components, therefore they can be characterized by the dynamic relationship between the pressure drop across their two corresponding endpoints and the flow through them \cite{master_aau}. 

\subsection{Pipe networks}
\label{pipe_networks}

Pipes have a major role in WSSs since they are used for carrying pressurized water. They serve as a connection between components. Normally, the pipe network can be split into different sub-parts, taking into account the physical characteristics and the attributes of the pipes. Therefore, water supply networks can consist of transmission mains, arterial mains, distribution mains and service lines as shown in the example below: 

%illustration of pipe topology / loop configuration
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/tikz/tree_configuration.tex} 
\caption{Illustration of pipe mains. Tree configuration.}
\label{fig:pipemain_example}
\end{figure}

Transmission mains deliver large amounts of water over long distances. Arterial and distribution mains provide intermediate steps towards delivering water to the end-users. Service lines transmit the water from the distribution mains straight to the end-users \cite{grigg2012water}.

The transmission and distribution network can have a topology that is called a loop or a tree structure. \figref{fig:pipemain_example} shows an example for a tree configuration. This type of configuration is most frequently used in rural areas \cite{mays}. Typically the network has only one path for the water to reach the end-users. A more frequent problem compared to looped configurations is, that on the outer parts of the system lower pressures can be experienced due to the pressure losses from long flow paths. The flow dynamics within this kind of systems therefore consist of large flows closer to the source that turn into smaller flows on the outer parts of the system. Main disadvantage of a purely tree structure system is that due to maintenance or momentary breakdowns, the system suffers disruption of service \cite{mays}. 

Loop networks have a configuration as shown in \figref{fig:loop_configuration}. 

%illustration of loop configuration
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\input{report/tikz/loop_configuration.tex} 
%\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{report/pictures/missingfigure}
\caption{Loop configuration.}
\label{fig:loop_configuration}
\end{figure}

Loop networks are usually composed of smaller loops which are composed of smaller distribution mains, and larger loops that are connected to arterial or transmission mains. Elevated reservoirs are typically placed in the centre of the system due to pressure losses resulting from flows through the loop network \cite{council2007drinking}. This is reasonable because within a certain grid, the same pressure is provided by the tank, instead of providing the pressure through long pipelines to different distances. Furthermore, in the presence of a ring structure, the large loop around the area may be used to feed an internal distribution grid or a distribution grid attached to the outer part of the loop. Loop configurations are generally associated with larger suburban and city distribution systems such as larger cities\cite{council2007drinking}. The Randers WSS falls into this category. 

\subsection{Elevated reservoirs}
\label{elevated_reservoirs}

Elevated reservoirs, or tanks, are typically placed in the system to use them as buffers and level out the pressure and flow demand differences. When the demand is high, the waterworks might not be able to provide the sufficient amount of water in the network. In these cases, the elevated reservoir supplies the remaining demand. When the user consumption decreases, the system can be controlled such that the tank is being refilled to provide the required demand for the next peak time of consumption. Having such an elevated reservoir in the network, the system becomes more independent of the pump stations, as the refilled tank can itself maintain the desired pressure and flow for a limited time. 

Due to the elevation of the tank, when it is filled up, the pumping stations need to provide a pressure higher than the pressure in the water tank. Therefore when the tank is being emptied, the pumping stations can reduce the amount of pressure they provide to the system, since the pressure from the elevated reservoir becomes dominant. This is due to the fact that the dynamics of systems with large storages come primarily from the pressure of the tank \cite{8thsemester_project}. However, it should be noted that normally the level in the tank is varying less than a meter. This means that the effect on the pump operation is limited. Due to these considerations, the dynamics of these elevated reservoirs has to be taken into account while modelling the system. 

\subsection{Pumps}
\label{pumps}

Water pumps are used to increase pressure in hydraulic systems, thus making the water flow. Pumps are typically the main actuators of a WSS and they can be either flow or pressure controlled. Therefore, pumps can have controllers to produce a desired flow or pressure. This is done by changing the rotational speed of the pump. In this way, when the pump has a reference pressure or flow, simple control makes it possible to produce the desired flow or pressure respectively \cite{kallesoePHD}.The pressure required to make the water reach some height is the sum of the pressure required to overcome the elevation and the friction losses in the pipe network. 

The most common pumps in WSSs are centrifugal pumps. Normally, the characteristics of such pumps are described by two pump curves. The two curves depict the volume flow versus the pressure and the power of the pump respectively. Normally the curves describe the characteristics for one particular speed, which is denoted the nominal speed \cite{kallesoePHD}. An example of these pump curves is shown in \figref{fig:pump_curves}.

\begin{figure}[H]

% \label{fig:pump curves}
% \end{figure}

As can be seen, at a given flow, the pump can deliver a pressure with a maximum limit. This pressure decreases when the flow is increasing. At a certain flow and pressure value, the pump has an optimal point where the operation is the most energy efficient. Pumps are normally designed such that the optimal point lies in the operational area for the pumping application \cite{kenneth_houe}. 

As in almost all WSSs, the flow is varying in the system, according to the flow demand from the end-consumers. Therefore, when dealing with varying flow in the system, pumps are often placed parallel at the pump stations such that they can keep their optimum points. As the flow increases, more pumps get activated to keep the pressure constant \cite{kenneth_houe}. 

\subsection{Valves}
\label{valves}

Valves in the WSS can be also seen as actuators along with pump elements. Unlike the pumps, valves are passive actuators in the sense that they do not consume energy. In principle, there are many types of valves existing. They can be categorized as non-return valves, control valves, shut-off valves and the combination of the two former one. Non-return valves allow waterflow only in one direction, while control valves can either adjust the flow or the pressure on their two endpoints. The former category is typically called a Flow Control Valve(FCV), while the latter is called a Pressure Reducer Valve or Pressure Regulating Valve(PRV). Shut-off valves are important components of the network since they can change the structure of the system, when for example doing maintenance or just redirecting the flow. This project deals with all three types of valves. 

Valves can be controlled such that no flow passes through. In these cases the valve is closed and thereby certain parts of the system can be isolated as mentioned above. Other possibility is that the valve is fully open. In such case the pressure drop between the two endpoints is experienced because of the friction loss of the valve.

\section{The Randers water supply network}
\label{the_randers_water_supply_network}

The Randers drinking WSS is managed by Verdo A/S, which is the main supplier of drinking water and heating to the city of Randers. Verdo supplies water to approximately 46.000 customers in Randers Municipality \cite{verdo}. The WSS is a complex, looped configuration with many different distribution areas. The coverage of the distribution areas are shown in \figref{fig:level_zones} below.

%illustration of distribution regions in Randers
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{report/pictures/level_zones}
\caption{Distribution zones in the Randers WSS.}
\label{fig:level_zones}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in \figref{fig:level_zones}, the network consists of many different distribution zones, however, the whole distribution map can be split into four main zones, according to the different geographical properties of the city. Furthermore, Randers is split into two regions, Randers North and Randers South. This is due to the fact that Randers fjord divides the city into two parts\cite{verdo} . 

The distribution network which is located in the southern part of the city is called Vilstrup zone. This zone has its own waterwork and pumping station which allows to supply the whole southern area by itself. This zone is shown in \figref{fig:vilstrup_region} below.

%Vilstrup region
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{report/pictures/Vilstrup_region}
\caption{Vilstrup zone in Randers.}
\label{fig:vilstrup_region}
\end{figure}

The only connection between Vilstrup and the northern region is through an emergency line, which is indeed used in emergency cases when the waterwork and pumping station in Vilstrup malfunctions or if there is a pollution in the water tanks. In these cases waterworks from the northern parts can provide water to the Vilstrup zone. Besides the emergency cases, Vilstrup does not rely on the waterworks and pumping stations in Randers North.  

Randers North consists of three different areas, each having its own particular geographical property. The water distribution in these regions are normally relies on each other, meaning that during a certain time period, the schedulings of the pumps are interconnected. 

The area shown in \figref{fig:highzone_region} below is called the High Zone(HZ) due to the high elevation level of the region. 

  %HZ region
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{report/pictures/Highzone_region}
\caption{High Zone in Randers.}
\label{fig:highzone_region}
\end{figure}

This part of the city lies approximately 55 meters above sea level, which means that big pumping effort is required to deliver the sufficient level of pressure to this area. 

The area underneath the HZ is called the Low Zone(LZ). This zone in Randers lies approximately on sea level. Therefore, the HZ and LZ have a significant elevation difference which requires special pumping solutions in this area. In order to get a visual overview of the geographical properties of the HZ and LZ, the elevation profile is shown between these two areas in \appref{elevation_profile_of_randers}, in \figref{fig:elev_profile} and \figref{fig:elev_profile1}. The area itself is shown in \figref{fig:lowzone_region}.

\caption{Low Zone in Randers.}
\label{fig:lowzone_region}
\end{figure}

The fourth main area in the Randers WSS is an area which according to its elevation neither belongs to the HZ, nor to the LZ. This area is called Hornbæk and shown in \figref{fig:hornbaek_region}.

  %Hornbaek region

\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{report/pictures/Hornbaek_region}

\end{figure}

The elevation in this area is around 30 meters above sea level and covers the western part of the city.  

\subsection{Waterworks and pumping stations}
\label{waterworks_and_pumping_stations}

Verdo provides drinking water by pumping water from groundwater bases and treating the water in four different water works. Due to the high quality of ground water, this water treatment is only aeration in some cases. The WSS in Randers has four waterworks and four pumping stations, in different locations. In order to draw a better picture of the pumping and waterwork stations in the system, first they are listed and named and secondly their geographical locations and properties are described. The waterworks and pumping stations are the following

\begin{table}[H]

    \begin{tabular}{| l | l | l |}
    \hline

    HNP & Hornbæk Pumping Station   \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Pumping stations in the network.}
\end{table}

In order to show the geographical location of the waterworks and pumping stations in the network, an illustration of the network model is shown where each pumping station and waterwork are labelled with its name. The network is shown in \figref{fig:pumping_stations_and_waterworks}.

  %Pumping stations and waterworks in Randers
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{report/pictures/verdo_pic}
\input{report/tikz/reservoirs_epanet.tex} 
\caption{Waterworks(encircled in blue) and Pumping stations(encircled in red) in the Randers network.}
\label{fig:pumping_stations_and_waterworks}
\end{figure}

The two main waterworks in the northern region are Bunkedal and Østrup Skov Waterworks. It is important to mention that in these areas, the water quality is sufficiently good, therefore clean water is pumped up to the surface. This is due to the fact that this groundwater lies under the ground such that it is protected by certain layers of the ground which makes it possible to provide this water without any kind of cleaning process, except aeration. These protection layers has been created by Randers fjord over the centuries due to glacial erosion (cite).

One of the drawbacks, however, is that the fresh water is located in the LZ, therefore the water has to be pumped from BKV and ØSV to locations with higher elevation. Since BKV and ØSV are the main sources to the HZ and LZ areas, in the worst case, water has to be pumped up approximately 55 meters above sea level. For this reason, the pumping station called Toldbodgade provides the sufficient amount of pressure to the HZ areas. In the HZ areas, at the border of LZ and HZ, there are two pumping stations, Hadsundvej and Hobrovej, which divides the water distribution in the HZ and LZ. 

As can be seen in \figref{fig:pumping_stations_and_waterworks}, the network in the HZ is a grid structure. The two main pump stations, HSP and HBP provide the sufficient pressure and flow to the grid and to the LZ areas, such that they keep a balance in pressure and flow. Furthermore, there is a water tank placed both at HSP and HBP. Since the HZ has an elevation of approximately 55 meters, the static pressure in each water tank at the two pumping stations is sufficient to provide pressure in the LZ areas, without any pumping effort. Therefore HSP and HBP provide pressure to the LZ areas such that the geodesic properties are exploited. An illustration of the two pumping stations and the HZ grid is shown in \figref{fig:HBP_HSP_grid}. 

 %HZ grid
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{report/pictures/missingfigure}
\input{report/tikz/grid_main_pumps.tex}
\caption{Hadsundvej and Hobrovej pumping stations with the HZ grid and LZ.}
\label{fig:HBP_HSP_grid}
\end{figure}

In order to avoid too high or too low pressure in the system, the pressure needs to be controlled alongside the flow. HBP is responsible for flow control, while HSP is responsible for the pressure control. Thereby it is avoided to provide the desired flow to the end-users with possibly with too high or too low pressure. 

Furthermore, in Hornbæk zone, the elevation is above sea level, and the static pressure from the two main pumping stations can not provide the desired pressure to this region. Therefore, boosting is needed which is supplied by the Oust Mølle Waterwork and the Hornbæk Pumping Station. OMV and HNP thereby are responsible for the Hornbæk zone.

As it is described in \secref{the_randers_water_supply_network}, the Vilstrup zone is an individual distribution network, if normal operation is assumed. Therefore, the Vilstrup Waterwork is able to provide all flow demands in Randers South, without the help of the other waterworks in Randers North. Due to this consideration, the WSS in Randers South can be discarded when the control of Randers North is analysed. 

In this report, the control of the two main pumping stations, Hadsundvej and Hobrovej is taken into account. This means that the Vilstrup region is indeed ignored, and the end-users are considered in the HZ, LZ and in Hornbæk region. With these considerations, the network simplifies to the following shown in \figref{fig:simplified_network}

 %Simplified network map

\caption{The simplified network map of the Randers WSS.}
\label{fig:simplified_network}
\end{figure}

The modelling of this system is going to be used for control purposes, which means that the model needs to be simple, but at the same time needs to have the same characteristics as of the original network. In the WSS in Randders, the control purpose is to find an optimal control scheme which is able to actuate the pumps at the two main pumping stations, such that the dynamic effect of the water tanks at each station are taken into account.
