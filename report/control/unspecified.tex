\chapter{Control}
\label{unspecified}

\emph{Until this point, an NN-based modelling approach has been introduced and a model has been derived based on measurement data from the supply network in Randers. This measurement data has been provided by Verdo A/S and yielded to be suitable for identification. In the further report, the focus is going to be on the control design, which is going to be based on the derived NN-based network model. Such control design is planned to be carried out within the frame of the $10^{th}$ semester project.}

The main part of the $9^{th}$ semester project ends here.
