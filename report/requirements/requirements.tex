\chapter{System Modelling}
\label{system_modelling}

\emph{This chapter gives a mathematical description of the component modelling. Therefore the different physical and mathematical measures of hydraulic systems are introduced The similarities to electronic network modelling is shown, by explaining the relevant properties of graph theory. In the end, the EPANET-based modelling approach is introduced.}
