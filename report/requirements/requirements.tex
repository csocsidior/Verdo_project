\chapter{System Modelling}
\label{system_modelling}

\emph{This chapter gives a mathematical description of the component modelling. The graph-based method of hydraulic system modelling is explained and introduced for the Randers Water System. Using the knowledge of the underlying graph of the system, the algorithm for reducing the system is discussed.}
