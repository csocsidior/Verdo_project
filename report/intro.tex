Due to the fast-paced technological development all over the world, the demand for industrial growth and energy resources has seen a rapid increase. Along with the industrial growth, the sudden rise in the population has made the world realize that shortage of energy sources is an actual and universally anticipated problem. In order to cope with these issues and to make the rapid development possible and less expensive, the world is moving towards more efficient use of resources and optimization of infrastructure. Besides efficiency, technological development is focused on green energy, resulting in more and more renewable energy sources added to the grid. 

Water Supply Systems(WSS) and other energy distribution infrastructures are among the most vital part of the human and industrial growth. A drinking water supply network is one of the most important infrastructures of all societies all over the world. However, providing drinking water is a highly energy-intensive activity. For example, in the United States alone, the drinking water and wastewater systems are typically the largest energy consumers accounting for 25 to 40 percent of a municipality's total energy bill \cite{fluctuating_price}.
