\chapter{RBFNN-based identification on an example network}
\label{NN_based_example}

\emph{In Appendix F., a numerical example of the system identification is carried out on a simple network.}

\section{The EPANET model}
\label{example1_EPANET}

The reason for testing the identification method on data from a simple EPANET model is that, in simulation, several different operations of the network can be studied. On a real world network, typically the operation or control cannot be taken to its extremes, as this would mean undesired service to the customers . Therefore, the network shown in \figref{fig:epanet_example1_id} has been created to mimic the behaviour of a multi-inlet, single-WT system, such that the identification method, presented in \chapref{identification_design} is being tested.

The network shown in \figref{fig:epanet_example1_id} consists of two pumping stations $PU_1$ and $PU_2$ and a Water Tank $TA$. Furthermore, reservoirs are present in the network, as in EPANET reservoirs are required for simulating pumps. These reservoirs $RE_1$ and $RE_2$ are different from WTs in the sense that they cannot be emptied in the simulation. Additionally, the physical and operational properties of the network can be found in \appref{physical_properties_example1}. 

The controls implemented on the network are based on simple time scheduling of the two pumping stations. Both pumps turn off when the pressure head in the WT is above $19.85 [m]$. $PU_2$ turns on again if the pressure head in the WT decreases to $19.55 [m]$. Furthermore, $PU_2$ turns on again only if the pressure head in node $n_1$ exceeds $43 [m]$. The initial pressure head in the WT is $19.5 [m]$.

\section{Identification}
\label{NN_based_example1} 

The identification is carried out on the simulation data, exported from EPANET. In order to validate the identification, in the first case, the total consumption is increased and then in the second case it is reduced. It is important to mention, that the control properties of the network are kept the same, as any modification in control would mean a new operating point of the WSS. Thus, the model is tested by modifying the demand and therefore creating different inlet pressure and flow settings of the pumping stations.
