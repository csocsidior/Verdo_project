\multirow{1}{4em}{1}
& The fluid in the network is water. & a \\

\multirow{2}{4em}{2} 
& All pipes in the system are filled up fully with water at all time. & a \\ 
\hline
\multirow{1}{4em}{3} 
& The pipes have a cylindrical structure and the cross section, $A(x)$, is constant for every $x \in [0,L]$.  & a \\ 
\hline
\multirow{1}{4em}{4} 
& The flow of water is uniformly distributed along the cross sectional area of the pipe and the flow is turbulent. & a \\

\multirow{1}{4em}{5} 
& $ z$, the change in elevation only occurs in pipes. & a \\ 
\hline
\multirow{1}{4em}{6} 
& Pumps in the network are of the type centrifugal. & a \\ 
\hline
\multirow{1}{4em}{7} 
& Tanks in the network have constant diameters. In other words, the walls of the tanks are vertical. & a \\

\multirow{1}{4em}{11} 
& Functions describing the pressure drops regarding the flow through them across the components of the system are continuously differentiable. & a \\ 
\hline
\multirow{1}{4em}{12} 
& At high flows, the Reynolds number is assumed to be constant. Therefore the Darcy friction factor, $f_D$ is assumed to be constant. & a \\
