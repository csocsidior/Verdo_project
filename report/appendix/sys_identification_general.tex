\section{Tasks in non-linear system identification}
\label{tasks_nonlinear_sys_identification}

Modelling and identifying a non-linear system is a challenging task because non-linear processes do not share properties such as the superposition law in linear systems. As for any identification method, the goal is to find a model which is capable to represent the behaviour of a process as closely as possible. The quality of the model is typically measured in terms of the error between the output of the process and the model. In \figref{fig:nonlin_block} an illustration is shown for a system identification arrangement

The process and model are fed with the same input signals, and their outputs are compared. This comparison gives an error signal $e$, which can be utilized for adapting the model. It should be noted, that in most cases the measurements on the output are disturbed by noise $n$. In order to carry out a succesful system identification, some major steps need to be performed, either by user interaction or using algorithms which can automatize these steps. \figref{fig:identification_loop} shows the system identification loop with the major steps

\subsection{Choice of the model inputs}
\label{choice_of_the_model_inputs}

The first step in the identification is typically realized by a trial-and-error approach to find out the influence of the different inputs on the process with the help of prior knowledge. In complex systems, where the number of inputs are high and their influence is not so well defined, some data-driven input selection might be very helpful. In this case, using all inputs can lead to extremely high-dimensional approximation problems, which implies the need for a huge number of parameters and increases the training time. Techniques for input data selection such as Principal Component Analysis(PCA) can be utilized in order to decide the relevance of certain inputs on the system. The main drawback of such techniques is that the relevance of an input is dependant only on the input data distribution, therefore sometimes highly relevant inputs are removed \cite{nelles2013nonlinear}.  Other techniques, such as correlation analysis for linear systems or genetic algorithms for non-linear systems can be also utilized.

\subsection{Choice of the model structure}
\label{choice_of_the_model_architecture}

The choice of the model architecture depends, among many factors on the type of the problem, the intended use, the insight into the real system behaviour, the complexity and the available data. The type of the problem can be for instance the approximation of a static system, or identification of the dynamics. In case of the WSS problem, both of them are considered. The intended use for the model architecture can differ whether the model is to be used for simulation, control or fault detection. Considering the insight, the complexity and the available data, three different modelling approaches can be distinguished\cite{nelles2013nonlinear}. These approaches are compared in \tabref{comparisontable_sysid}.

As shown in \tabref{comparisontable_sysid}, White box models are completely derived by first principles, i.e., by physical laws. The parameters and equations, describing the whole network can be determined by theoretical modelling, as it was done for our system in \chapref{system_modelling}. Black box models however, are based on measurement data, which means that the model describing the system is developed based on the characteristics of the data. In order to carry out a successful Black box modelling, very little insight or prior knowledge is required, however it is important to have a well-describing input-output data set. The combination or compromise between Black and White box models is called Gray box modelling. In this case, the knowledge from first principles and the information contained in the measurement data are both utilized. The blank fields in \tabref{comparisontable_sysid} for Grey box models are left blank because the properties of such models lie between White and Black box modelling. Typically, when Grey box modelling is considered, the main goal is to overcome some of the most restrictive factors of the White and Black box approaches for the specific application. For example, some prior knowledge might be incorporated into a Black box model in order to ensure reasonable behaviour\cite{nelles2013nonlinear}. 

\subsection{Model validation}
\label{model_validation}

The easiest type of validation is to check the quality of the model on the input-output data set. If this does not give satisfactory results, the model is not accepted. In this case, it can be either concluded that information is missing from the input or the model is not flexible enough to describe the corresponding input-output relations. In case if the performance achieved on the data set is acceptable, it is desirable to test the model on a new data set, especially if noise is present in the system. It should be noted however, that this new testing data should excite the system in the same operating regions, as the model was trained on. Otherwise, the model might fail the validation.
