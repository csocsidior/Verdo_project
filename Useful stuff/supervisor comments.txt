local booster in the basement - at the buildings, not in the area! Bossting 
is in steps and they are using PRVs. 

P.7 elevated reservoir in the centre -> it is directly distributed to all surrounuding
areas, not through long pipes. In the centre -> provide the same pressure around 

Reference 12 - mistake in the author. 

P.7 -> explain larger loops better -> like the AAU test setup -> figure ! 

P.8 -> not levelling out the pressure (less then 2 meters, normally around 1 meter)

elevated reservoir -> the flow contribution is high, the pressure change in meter is
not so high.

P.8 Valves -> changes the structure of the network by closing off parts 
-> adative structure form for control 

PRVs and FCVs -> used to control flow, nowdays they are not used for control 

normally in one loop there are not any pumps and valves 

sectioning in the network possible? ->
