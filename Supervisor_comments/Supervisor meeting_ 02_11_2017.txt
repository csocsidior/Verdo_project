Supervisor meeting 

flow out of the tanks -> measured? 
linear dynamics
polynomial based tool for system id. 
RBF NN - > radial basis functions 
Bernstein polynomials if we choose splines as radial basis functions 
nntool-> matlab 
nntool
output-> from EPANET model

change the output equation to P_k ->OK
\sigma is an unknown variable in the real world
the dynamic equations are non-recursive -> not necessary to use recursive NNs 

21st -> Tuesday 10.000 supervisor meeting. 



Supervisor meeting with Jan and Tom

If too many neurons -> overfit of the function -> stop when it's a reasonable amount
Since there is no measurement noise, everything is assumed to be deterministic in the model
-> There is no need of training and validation data, training data is sufficient, as the outcome for the
two identification procedure would be the same
A_2^T mistake !!!!!
