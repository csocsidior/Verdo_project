dynamics of the pipes -> say something about low freq. dynamics Pressure shocks, hammering. 
in reality -> closing valves create pressure shocks 
friction factor -> consider it as constant, because it won't be such a big error 
compared to the EPANET results 
(3.7) -> change the order and say positive scalar. 
(3.9) -> model works only for positive flow 

inclusion of WT 
pressure measurements -> flow control is suitable 
ask Randers -> pressure or flow controller at the pumping stations 

(3.17) mistake in the definition of d!!!

The numeric solver is not correct !!!!!

column rank! when pseudo inverse is considered

U^T*U -> has to have block identity 


correct the sign mistake in the demands!!!! -> out on a graphical example 
with a pipe 








SUP meeting 2nd

mass conservation idea- > dot_p_t
passivity expressiion -> prove stability
